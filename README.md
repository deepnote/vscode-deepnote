# 🚀 Deepnote in VS Code, Cursor and Windsurf - data notebook for AI era
Run Deepnote locally inside VS Code, Cursor and Windsurf — not Jupyter — and unlock the next generation of data workflows:
- 🧠 **SQL in VS Code** — Run SQL queries out of the box, no extensions needed
- 🧩 **Rich block types** — Combine Python, Markdown, data visualizations, tables, and more — all in one place
- 🔐 **Native database connections** — Securely connect to Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, and 60+ other sources via VS Code’s encrypted SecretStorage API
- ⚙️ **Init notebooks** — Auto-run setup code (dependencies, env setup) before execution
- 📦 **Smart requirements** — Generate `requirements.txt` automatically for reproducible runs

🐍 **Jupyter kernel, upgraded**
- ⚡ **Deepnote kernel** — Fully `.ipynb-compatible`, tuned for modern data workflows
- 🔁 **Kernel control** — Restart, interrupt, and switch seamlessly

🌐 **Deepnote ecosystem integrations**
- 🔃 **Auto-refresh** — Instantly detects file and data changes
- 🧮 **Multi-notebook support** — Work across multiple notebooks in one unified project
- ☁ **Cloud collaboration** — Switch between local VS Code and Deepnote Cloud to collaborate live on the same file with your team

## 📋 Requirements

- **Visual Studio Code** 1.103.0 or higher
- **Python** 3.10 or higher (for running notebooks)
- **Node.js** 22.15.1 or higher (for development)

## 🎯 Getting started

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Cmd+P` or `Ctrl+P` to open Quick Open
3. Type `ext install Deepnote.vscode-deepnote`
4. Press Enter

Or install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Deepnote.vscode-deepnote)

### Opening your first Deepnote notebook

1. Open a folder containing `.deepnote` project files
2. Look for the Deepnote icon in the Activity Bar (sidebar)
3. Click on a notebook in the Deepnote Explorer to open it
4. Select a Python kernel when prompted
5. Start coding!

## 📖 Usage

### Command palette

Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `Deepnote` to see all available commands:

| Command                            | Description                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `Deepnote: Refresh Explorer`       | Refresh the Deepnote project explorer              |
| `Deepnote: Open Notebook`          | Open a specific notebook from a Deepnote project   |
| `Deepnote: Open File`              | Open the raw .deepnote project file                |
| `Deepnote: Reveal in Explorer`     | Show active notebook information in the explorer   |
| `Deepnote: Manage Integrations`    | Configure database connections and credentials     |
| `Deepnote: New Project`            | Create a new Deepnote project                      |
| `Deepnote: Import Notebook`        | Import an existing notebook into your project      |
| `Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel` | Select or switch kernels within your notebook      |
| `Notebook: Change Cell Language`   | Change the language of the cell currently in focus |

### Database integrations

Configure database connections for SQL blocks:

1. Open Command Palette
2. Run `Deepnote: Manage Integrations`
3. Add your database credentials (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, etc.)
4. Use SQL blocks in your notebooks with the configured integrations

Credentials are securely stored using VS Code's encrypted storage and never leave your machine.

### Working with SQL Blocks

SQL blocks allow you to query databases directly from your notebooks:

```sql
-- Query your PostgreSQL database
SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01'
```

Results are displayed as interactive tables that you can explore and export.

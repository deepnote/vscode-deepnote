A powerful [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension that brings [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) notebook capabilities directly into your favorite editor. Work with enhanced data science notebooks featuring SQL blocks, database integrations, and collaborative features - all within VS Code.

## üöÄ Features

![Deepnote Projects](./images/deepnote-projects.png)

### Enhanced Notebook Experience

Deepnote notebooks extend traditional Jupyter notebooks with powerful data science features:

- **üî¢ Multiple Block Types** - Work with Python code, SQL queries, Markdown documentation, and specialized data science blocks
- **üîÑ Seamless Language Switching** - Switch between Python and SQL within the same notebook without context switching
- **üóÑÔ∏è Database Integrations** - Connect directly to PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, and other data sources with secure credential management
- **‚ö° Init Notebooks** - Automatically run initialization code (dependencies, environment setup) before notebook execution
- **üì¶ Automatic Requirements** - Generate `requirements.txt` from your project settings for reproducible environments
- **üé® Rich Outputs** - View data visualizations, tables, and interactive outputs directly in VS Code
- **üîê Secure Credential Storage** - Safely store and manage database credentials using VS Code's encrypted SecretStorage API

### Jupyter Kernel Support

Built on top of robust Jupyter infrastructure:

- **üêç Python Kernel** - Full Python support with IPython features
- **üîå Custom Deepnote Kernel** - Enhanced kernel with Deepnote-specific features and integrations
- **üìä Interactive Debugging** - Debug notebooks cell-by-cell with VS Code's debugger
- **üîÑ Kernel Management** - Easy kernel selection, restart, and interrupt capabilities

### Project Management

- **üìÅ Project Explorer** - Browse and manage Deepnote projects directly from VS Code's sidebar
- **üìì Multi-Notebook Support** - Work with multiple notebooks from the same project
- **üîç Quick Navigation** - Jump between notebooks and files with command palette integration
- **‚ôªÔ∏è Auto-Refresh** - Automatic detection of project file changes

## üìã Requirements

- **Visual Studio Code** 1.103.0 or higher
- **Python** 3.8 or higher (for running notebooks)
- **Node.js** 22.15.1 or higher (for development)

## üéØ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P` to open Quick Open
3. Type `ext install Deepnote.vscode-deepnote`
4. Press Enter

Or install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Deepnote.vscode-deepnote)

### Opening Your First Deepnote Notebook

1. Open a folder containing `.deepnote` project files
2. Look for the Deepnote icon in the Activity Bar (sidebar)
3. Click on a notebook in the Deepnote Explorer to open it
4. Select a Python kernel when prompted
5. Start coding!

## üìñ Usage

### Command Palette

Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux) and type `Deepnote` to see all available commands:

| Command                            | Description                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `Deepnote: Refresh Explorer`       | Refresh the Deepnote project explorer              |
| `Deepnote: Open Notebook`          | Open a specific notebook from a Deepnote project   |
| `Deepnote: Open File`              | Open the raw .deepnote project file                |
| `Deepnote: Reveal in Explorer`     | Show active notebook information in the explorer   |
| `Deepnote: Manage Integrations`    | Configure database connections and credentials     |
| `Deepnote: New Project`            | Create a new Deepnote project                      |
| `Deepnote: Import Notebook`        | Import an existing notebook into your project      |
| `Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel` | Select or switch kernels within your notebook      |
| `Notebook: Change Cell Language`   | Change the language of the cell currently in focus |

### Database Integrations

Configure database connections for SQL blocks:

1. Open Command Palette
2. Run `Deepnote: Manage Integrations`
3. Add your database credentials (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, etc.)
4. Use SQL blocks in your notebooks with the configured integrations

Credentials are securely stored using VS Code's encrypted storage and never leave your machine.

### Working with SQL Blocks

SQL blocks allow you to query databases directly from your notebooks:

```sql
-- Query your PostgreSQL database
SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01'
```

Results are displayed as interactive tables that you can explore and export.

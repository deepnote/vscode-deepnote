    // 2. Mocking file system operations
    // 3. Mocking the importClient API calls
    // 4. Mocking window.withProgress
    // 5. Mocking env.openExternal
    //
    // These are better suited for integration tests rather than unit tests.
    // The core logic is tested through the importClient tests.
